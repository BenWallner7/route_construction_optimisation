# Route Construction Optimisation

You are tasked with solving a route construction optimization problem. Given three sets of 2D coordinate points, your objective is to construct an optimal path that maximizes the number of goal points visited while satisfying specific constraints.

## Different Optimisation Approaches

- Greedy Nearest-Neighbour algorithm with constraint validation.
